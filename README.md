## Design Tables

Description:In this assignment I created multiple configurations of this spool shape. I learned how to use a design table to create configurations and had a refresher on patterning.

Lessons Learned: When making many configurations of something design tables is very helpful!! Donâ€™t try to make the configurations individually! Also, name each configuration something helpful that gives you an idea what it is.

## Advanced and Mechanical Mates

Description: In this assignment I created a linear extender controlled by a pin. I learned how to use several advanced and mechanical mates such as a slot mate. I also used a configuration. 

Lessons Learned: I learned that you can add a feature to design tables and then use design tables to suppress that feature on some of the configurations but not all of them.
